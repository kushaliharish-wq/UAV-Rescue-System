UAV RESCUE SYSTEM


This project helps disaster rescue teams identify the level of injury in persons through the location of wounds on a person. 

Using CNN images frames from videos captured by Unmanned Autonomous vehicles are categorized into images with an identifying label around the location of injury on the human.
The number of such wounds can be used by rescue teams to estimate the level of medication required for rescue operations helping them prepare better.

Project uses python and predominantly uses tensorflow library to build CNN.Relu and sigmoid activation functions are used and an accuracy of 85% is achieved with the models prediction.


In the future, I wish to work with a higher computing power to decrease pixelation in the prediction images. Currently the video from which frames were divided was captured using system webcam which can further be integrated with a UAV like drone, remote car with a camera etc.
